Based on your knowledge, please think step-by-step, analyze the current reasoning of the presenter from a scientifically rigorous point of view, and analyze how to modify the presenter's current reasoning in the light of other people's discussions, your own knowledge, and your own logic.

The current step does not consider the case ...\n So it should be modified to reason as follows: [Step x] Determine ...(You only need to modify one step instead of the all!!!)
