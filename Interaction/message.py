    """
    The Message class encapsulates a single communication event within the system,
    containing:
      - content (the textual payload)
      - send_from (the sender's name or identifier)
      - send_to (the receiver's name or identifier, or 'ALL' for broadcast)
      - timestamp (when the message was created or dispatched)
      - msg_id (a unique UUID to distinguish messages unambiguously)

    This structure supports concurrency, multi-agent backtracking, and advanced
    searching or filtering by ID or time. Agents and environments use these
    messages to coordinate steps, detect conflicts, and manage rollbacks.
